This repository is a bit of my code that I am using to write similar code to the 
Mastering Kafka Streams and KsqlDB Book by Mitch Seymour, his repository for his code is :
https://github.com/mitch-seymour/mastering-kafka-streams-and-ksqldb

and the book:
Kafka: The Definitive Guide: Real-Time Data and Stream Processing at Scale 2nd Edition
by Gwen Shapira (Author), Todd Palino (Author), Rajini Sivaram (Author), Krit Petty (Author)


(All code here, will be written by me, since the code in the books will be focused on Java, I need to essentially translate it into Python)


Also, the docker-compose.yml file I will use (at least the exact copy and paste is inside chapter-02-python)
Is from Confluent:
